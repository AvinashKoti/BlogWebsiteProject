        <h2>Why I Write</h2>
        <p>
          I don’t write to preach, persuade, or decorate myself with titles. I
          write because silence sometimes refuses to stay silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          My words are not bound to one genre or philosophy. Some confront blind
          belief. Some whisper quiet reflections. Others trace the invisible
          thread between ancient stories and modern minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing, for me, is a mirror. Not always polished. Not always
          comforting. But real — inviting you to pause, turn inward, and
          question what you’ve always accepted.
        </p>

          “Truth isn’t branded. It’s invited.”
